# Vertex Engine

The Vertex Engine is a graphical engine for games and other graphical programs.
It is written in C#, using the OpenTK toolkit, a C# implementation of OpenGL.

The engine provides high-level functionality for 3D and 2D graphics, to allow for quick prototyping with little overhead, as well as allowing for extending the lower-level functionality for more complex use-cases.

## Compatibility
The engine has been tested to work in Windows and Linux environments.
